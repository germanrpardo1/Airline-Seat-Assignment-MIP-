## Combinatorial Optimisation course project (accepted for publication in the Journal of Air Transport Management)
This research presents an innovative, comprehensive model aiming to maximise profit from airlines' ancillary services,
particularly focusing on passenger accommodation services. To navigate the competitive airline industry landscape,
this study introduces a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model designed to encourage passengers to invest
in seat changes, thus adding a novel revenue stream. To address the complexity of group reservations, we propose a
multi-objective model that manages passengers booking under the same reservation in a strategic, fictitious separation
seeking that passengers of the same reservation seek to be together and stimulate the change of seats. In recognizing
the stochastic nature of seat sales, we have developed a simple, computationally efficient methodology that blocks
premium seats aiming to increase the overall revenue. This mechanism intelligently positions passengers who do not
desire seat changes in seats with a lower likelihood of future sales, optimizing seat utility for prospective upgrading
customers. In a critical advancement, our model incorporates computational acceleration techniques, enabling realtime implementation by airlines. This rapid response capability empowers airlines to adapt swiftly to changing
dynamics in seat bookings, thereby maximising their revenue generation potential. By offering a sophisticated tool for
increasing profits from passenger accommodation services, this research bridges an essential gap in existing airline
industry strategies, proposing a transformative approach to ancillary service optimisation.
